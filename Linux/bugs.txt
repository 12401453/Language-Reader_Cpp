1.) Updating a lemma-meaning does not change the tooltip for other different-formed versions of that lemma in the same text (need to change updateLemmaTooltip() to look for same lemma_ids, which is not really possible without more database lookups because I purposefully do not store lemma_id's as data-attributes in the HTML)


3.) PONS Bulgarian scraper ignores additional head-entries if the search-term throws up more than one
4.) PONS Bulgarian scraper can sometimes resort to a google-translate style thing which causes an error in my parser; I need to check for and handle it
5.) PONS Bulgarian scraper fails silently when searching for "така че" even though it does give a German definition. Also разделя, така наречен
6.) Bulgarian plurals (e.g. <-та> on the entry for кранче, or връх <върхъ̀т, върховѐ, zählb: въ̀рха >) are omitted by my scraper

7.) Add this to the scrapeDictCC extractText function: 
else if(child.InnerText == "Unverified" && HasStyleValues(child.GetAttributeValue("style", ""), "background-color", "red"))
{
    txt += "<span style=\"color:red;\"><em>unverified</em></span>";
}
